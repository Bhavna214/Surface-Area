Let's discover how to find the surface area of a cube with the help of an activity.<br> Here are the steps:<br>
1. <b>Visualize six squares: </b>We know that, each face of the cube is a square. Thus, make six identical squares each of side "a" units.<br><br>
2. <b>Assemble the cube: </b>Join all the faces to form a cube.<br><br>
3. <b>Focus on one face:</b> Since each square has sides of length "a," the area of one square (one face of the cube) is "a^2" units. <br><br>
4. <b>Calculate total area:</b> The total surface area of the cube is found by adding up the areas of all six squares (faces). 
<br>&nbsp &nbsp i.e. Surface area of cube = Sum of areas of all 6 squares.
